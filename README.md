    How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
      -There are several testing methods that one can use to ensure that your code, program, or software is functional and secure. Static testing can be used to assess software to ensure that it meets verification specifications without running code. Unit testing is a good way to break up code into smaller and more manageable parts for testing. Functionality testing is often the final step of testing used to ensure a program functions as intended and meets client requirements.
      
    How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
      -User needs are interpreted through requirements. Incorporating them into a program will take time and some tweaking since user needs could change or be unrealistic to meet.
      
    How do I approach designing software?
      -My approach to software design is to gain as much knowledge as I can before touching any code. Gathering resources beforehand lets me plan on how I am going to tackle designing quality software in a effecient way.
